Age: 13

	Going to school feels different now... Everyone seems to be joining different clubs and cliques...
School work is getting harder too, and I'm not really sure what to focus on in school...
I want to do well both socially and academically, but worrying about them both is not really helping...
I've been struggling with school work, and my wish of making new friends in a new community is still just a thought...
I've been getting nightmares of bad grades, angry teachers, and sometimes... the image of myself looking so helpless in the mirror...
