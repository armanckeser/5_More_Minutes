Age: 23

	I should have listened when people told me back then that the outside world is not the same as the
protective environment I grew up in. Work is incomparable to school, co-workers are not friends, and 
my boss has a much greater potential to change my life for the better or for worse than any of my teachers
I've had throughout my life. Regardless of my condition, an absence at work has intimidating repercussions
than any number of absences combined at school. I really find my workplace tough and challenging, and sometimes
it haunts me at night...
