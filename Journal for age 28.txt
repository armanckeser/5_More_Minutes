	What is love? I can't really definitively describe it myself, but it sure is powerful. Whenever
I am with the person I love, I just feel like I can do anything and everything. I feel relaxed and comfortable,
but also passionate and excited at the same time. This person really shapes me up and I really feel like
myself when we spend time together. I know we can accomplish anything that gets in our way together - I'll
admit that I've dreamed of us achieving goals that no individual can ever accomplish!
