Age: 18

	Nearing the end of school, and getting ready for college, I've been facing rejections in multitude of ways.
College, the hot girl that I've been crushing on for all four of my high school years, and most recently, my parents.
It seems like we tend to disagree on every big and little thing, and at this point, I just can't wait to leave home. 
Of course, I love and respect my parents, but I feel old and independent enough to find my own place in the outside
world now. Sometimes, I dream about my parents and how disharmonized we are, but I can't hurt them... they're my family.
