	School is so fun! Lots of friends! I sing, and learn, and play together with lots of friends!
But there's some mean kids even in my class... Like during recess, when my friends and I are playing basketball,
a group of big, scary-looking, mean kids come up and just take the ball away from us and start playing in the other courts...
I wish we can take the ball back, but my friends and I are little and the mean bullies are big, so we are always scared...
Sometimes, in my dreams, I become strong and beat up those bullies! It makes me so happy!
